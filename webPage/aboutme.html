        <p> <img src="Lee.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left">
        I am passionate about the Programing industry, 
           as I seek to become a professional in the field. 
           I am also passionate about learning as I believe that the future is only brighter when a person is constantly gaining new information.
           I value giving back to those less fortunate, through mentoring and tutoring. I strongly believe that education is a never-ending process of intellectual growth.  
        
        I matriculated in 2015 at the Centre of Science and Technology (COSAT) where we had 
          Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and IT (Information Technology) as major
          subjects.

          After I matriculated I spent 3 years volunteering, mentoring and tutoring students in English, Mathematics and Coding. 
           Throughout that I learnt alot, in the beginning it was just about giving back to the community not knowing that I will 
           learn from the community.
